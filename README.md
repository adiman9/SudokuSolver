# SudokuSolver
While learning to program in C I stumbled across Richard Bucklands lectures on the language from UNSW. During these lectures he mentions building a Sudoku Solver.

This repo is my attempt at building such a solver in C with some primitive, clunky CLI graphics to display the data. The UI for IO is awful but the code does manage to solve the sudoku puzzles it is given. It was a fun program to write and did further strengthen my understanding of the way the C language works and my knowledge of the syntax.
